# Coastal buffering

Code to create buffers of land or catchment polygons that only extend seaward. Buffer boundaries must align with land/catchment polygon boundaries and not overlap.

This code has been further developed into a function called [regional_seas](https://statnmap.com/2020-07-31-buffer-area-for-nearest-neighbour/)
