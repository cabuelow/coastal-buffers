In the case of orthophotos and satellite imagery the accuracy is within +/- 5 metres of actual position, whereas features compiled from DCDB data is related to the accuracy of the DCDB at the time of capture, and the accuracy of features captured from existing printed topographic maps is within +/- 12.5 metres of actual position.  In cases where data has been field verified the accuracy will be sub-metre.  While the data can be used for a range of purposes, generally the expected average horizontal accuracy is within +/- 12.5 metres of true position.<br/>

                    <em>Lineage statement:</em><div>In developing a Water Plan, the process generally includes the following stages:<br/>- technical assessments (environmental, economic, social, hydrologic and cultural data)<br/>- preliminary stakeholder consultation<br/>- preparation of a draft water plan<br/>- publication of draft plan and opportunity for public submissions<br/>- consideration of submissions<br/>- finalization and approval of water plan<br/><br/>Science underpins the development of water plans. These technical assessments include:<br/>- environmental assessments: ecological modelling using data collected on the flow requirements of ecosystems<br/>- hydrologic assessments: models which draw on over 100 years of recorded flow data<br/>- social, economic and cultural assessments: identification of water related social, economic and cultural values.<br/><br/>Consultation with a range of interested people including:<br/>- regional communities<br/>- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups<br/>- conservation groups<br/>- industry<br/>- local government.<br/><br/>The available water can be granted through water licenses and tradeable water allocations.<br/>A certain amount of water is reserved as unallocated water.<br/><br/>As part of the Water Plan development process, spatial datasets are created for use in the water plan, mapping and in public consultation.<br/>Water Services Officers across the state consult with Spatial Information Officers in the interpretation of the technical assessments and community consultation to compile these spatial datasets.<br/>In the first instance, a water plan area is the corresponding drainage basin with modifications as required to meet the needs of the plan.<br/>This may mean following cadastral boundaries rather than topological features.<br/>Mapping scale is generally 1:100,000 and enhanced in places with larger scale mapping (for example 1:25,000) and in places by visiting the location and ground truthing.</div>
